**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.


## 1. Engineering Principles

### 1.1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 1.2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 1.3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 1.4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


## 2. Harness Engineering Orchestrator Instructions

Read:
- `harness/AGENTS.md`
- `harness/docs/harness_workflow.md`

### 2.1. Task Scale Decision (mandatory before any src/ change)

- Small(Bug fix, util addition, single-module edit): Generator → Evaluator → commit
- Large(New module, pipeline design, multi-module change): Planner → Generator → Evaluator → commit
  + Create `docs/exec_plans/<task>/SPEC.md` (large tasks only)

### 2.2. Invariants
- Generator and Evaluator MUST be called as separate sub-agents (isolation is the point).
- All `src/` changes MUST run inside a worktree — never edit the main worktree directly.
- Agents communicate via files only — no direct invocation between agents.
- Skip SPEC.md and SELF_CHECK.md for small tasks; pass the user request directly to Generator.


## 3. Project Rules

### 3.1. Environment Variables
- NEVER read or modify `.env`
- Modify `.env.example` only

### 3.2. Cleanup
- Remove temporary and debug files before finishing
- NEVER create: `temp_*`, `*_new`, `*_old`, `*_backup`

### 3.3. Execution
- Local: `uv`
- Docker: `pip + requirements.txt`
- `alembic/` 마이그레이션 파일 수정 후 도커 재적용 시 반드시 이미지 재빌드 필요:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  docker compose build --no-cache api
  docker compose up -d postgres redis
  docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head
  ```

### 3.4. Code
- Use type hints
- Use `logging`, never `print()`
- Add Korean docstrings to Python functions and classes
- Never use Chinese characters: write "분석", not "분析" or "分析"

### 3.5. Commits
- Commit only after tests pass
- Keep commits atomic
- Write commit messages in Korean

### 3.6. Naming
- Use `snake_case` for files, folders, and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Wrap file paths in backticks

### 3.7. Efficiency
- Do not reread files already read
- Run tool calls in parallel when possible
- Do not repeat user-provided information

### 3.8. Code Search
- Use Serena plugin first
- Use bash `grep` only as a fallback

### 3.9. Code Editing
- Use `Edit` / `Write` tools directly for all code modifications
- Never use Serena's `replace_content` for edits (causes unnecessary permission prompts)
